    <h4 style="color:white;text-align:center">"One hundred and fifty years of metaphysical rebellion and of nihilism have witnessed<br> the persistent reappearance, under different guises, of the same<br> ravaged countenance: the face of human protest. All of them, decrying the human<br> condition and its creator, have affirmed the solitude of man and the nonexistence<br> of any kind of morality. But, at the same time, they have all tried to construct a purely terrestrial<br> kingdom where their chosen principles will hold sway. As rivals of the Creator, they<br> have inescapably been led to the point of reconstructing creation according to their own concepts.<br> Those who rejected, for the sake of the world they had just created, all other principles but desire<br> and power, have rushed to suicide or madness and have proclaimed the apocalypse. As for the rest, who<br> wanted to create their own principles, they have chosen pomp and ceremony, the<br> world of appearances, or banality, or again murder and destruction."<br><br>
