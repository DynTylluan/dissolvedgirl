    <h1 style="color:white;text-align:center;">RECORD OF AWAKENINGS</h1>
    <h3 style="color:white;text-align:center;">JANUARY 15, 2019</h3>
    <h4 style="color:red;text-align:center;">lately it feels like time has been moving faster than<br> usual. or better said, it feels like evolutions in emotions and sentiments<br> of mine have been occurring faster than usual, my views and<br> thoughts becoming more extreme and solidified as time<br> goes by. to be honest, i don’t know exactly where i am, and there is more than one<br> way that that statement applies to me. i feel like a pot of scolding water on the verge of boiling<br> over… so dangerously close to spilling over.. and what that may cause is yet<br> to be seen and most likely a hazard, to myself and others. i’m afraid of my currently unknown<br> capacity for pain and misery and anger. each time it gets exponentially worse<br> and worse. my soul is in deep suffering and dis-belonging. i have done<br> quite a good job at keeping all of the explosive energy<br> inside of me but every time… worse and worse. and worse. like a new<br> channel of emotion inside me opens and more anger and frustration and<br> sadness fills it. there are no adequate words to describe<br> the feeling. the wound is so fucking deep, and every day and every<br> night something twists a knife into the wound deeper and deeper, playing<br> with the blood and torturing me for… what? for what? to learn a lesson? karma?<br> <i>why does it have to be this way?</i>, i ask… but i know that the<br> answer to that question is that, <i>it just has to be this way</i>.</h3> 
    <h3 style="color:white;text-align:center;">NOVEMBER 15, 2018</h3>
    <h4 style="color:red;text-align:center;">disillusionment clouds my senses day after day; the nights<br> are even worse. i can’t help this feeling that takes over<br> me — that i live in a world of puppets, so quick to please their<br> maker and so quick to dedicate their lives to fitting in. somehow, for<br> them, it is far, far easier to play the game than it is for<br> me. it seems like everybody has mastered the game while i struggle just to stay on the<br> board. but no, fuck no, i refuse to do this anymore. soon, i will<br> no longer play this game, i will no longer sit on the board. this pathetic<br> fucking game where i am just a pawn, or less. i never<br> should’ve been here in the first place.<br> this reality isn’t mine. nothing here feels like it belongs to<br> me, not even my home. all i have are the strange memories<br> i’ve attached to places in a reality not made for me. all i have are my never ending<br> thoughts. nothing in this world has ever held onto me, even with me having clung<br> to them with all my might. all i have is myself<br> here... barely. just barely.<br><br><br>
    <h3 style="color:white;text-align:center;">SEPTEMBER 13, 2018</h3>
    <h4 style="color:red;text-align:center;">i wish i could just hide myself away from any and all who know me. i <br> wish i could hide myself out of sheer embarrassment<br> of the person that i am; just an incomplete, pointless, disappointing being who<br> doesn’t belong even in the slightest. one who is granted nothing but<br> scraps and the worst and last option of every situation, dealt<br> the worst hands. it seems i’ve thought my way out of the safe<br> limits of human thought and into territory that brings emptiness and misery. and<br> here i thought that thinking this far would create an enlightened<br> being who was not afraid of the Everything... all it’s done is<br> create somebody who can no longer function in a life suited only for<br> those who stay within the safe limits of thought. it created somebody<br> who craves and craves and desires escape yet fears everything from the<br> trivialities to the most important aspects of the universe. constantly shying<br> away. can’t do anything right. don’t want to do anything right.<br><br>i can’t even begin to explain to you how difficult it is to live with myself, to<br> possess this mind. just constant paradoxes and cognitive dissonance<br> and  layer upon layer upon layer of issues that seemingly<br> cannot be solved without giving up some sort of integrity. not<br> fair not fair not fair to have to live like this!!!!! it’s<br> not fucking fair to have to be alive like this. it’s too<br> late to go back to ever living a simple life, nor would i even<br> want to. there is no way to think backwards, it’s already done. fate<br> decided to give me this life full of these non-human feelings and thoughts<br> and should expect nothing less than self destruction. what more<br> could you possibly fucking expect - you give me this life<br> and you want me to keep going? to keep living in this society that i’ve<br> already figured out and that i hate with all my heart?<br> you expect me to stay?<br> you’ve really got another thing coming.<br><br><br>
    <h3 style="color:white;text-align:center;">SEPTEMBER 4, 2018</h3>
    <h4 style="color:red;text-align:center;">i wish i could distance myself from everybody in this fucking world, as<br> far away as possible from this poison that is the <br>human race. i can’t stand anybody that surrounds me, i don’t wanna<br> hear anymore human’s voices, only about 10 of them or less that i can stand<br> to be around, but only one voice i truly want to hear every day<br> and yet i can’t... life is merciless and i will always question why this universe decided<br> to create humans.. we are a tragic, pathetic story<br> in the making, and i feel like the only one who sees it. i feel above everybody <br>else, i feel like the only one who isn’t blind to everything. it’s<br> a lonely, lonely fucking world to think the way i do and to<br> know the things that i know.</h3><br><br><br>
    <h3 style="color:white;text-align:center;">AUGUST 20, 2018</h3>
    <h4 style="color:red;text-align:center;">i just have this terrible fucking feeling that i can’t </br>get rid of and i’ve never felt it before and it just will not go</br> away. i feel finished. i feel gone already, i am going</br> to be gone soon. my spirit cannot handle this weight, this life; i can’t</br> do it anymore i can’t do this i am fucking miserable. how do i explain</br> something so unexplainable… i am too jaded, too ready to die. i can’t live in </br>this discomfort on this earth anymore. i just can’t.</h4><br><br><br>
    <h3 style="color:white;text-align:center;">AUGUST 14, 2018</h3>
    <h4 style="color:red;text-align:center;">i feel below everybody else in this life. i feel like nothing, like</br> dust, living in this world. i feel like a fucking idiot, like </br>everybody and everything is laughing at me, pitying me. just a lone speck of worthless</br> dust, floating aimlessly, constantly in pain. below everybody else.</br> not belonging, no purpose, wasting my breath, every day. everybody</br> is laughing at me. i’m already fucking fading away.</h4><br><br><br>

    <h3 style="color:white;text-align:center;">AUGUST 11, 2018</h3>
    <h4 style="color:red;text-align:center;">maybe the problem was that i felt i owed something to the world, and </br>then no matter what i did it just didn't seem like enough.</br>i would do nothing and consequently i would feel horrible about myself. and </br>then i started realizing that maybe it wasn't me</br>that owed this world something, it was the world that owed something to me.</br>for all the shit i have been through, for everything i felt that </br>i never imagined it would be possible to feel, maybe the world</br>owed me some fucking compensation for making me feel like the</br>loneliest person to ever live.</h4><br><br><br>
    <h3 style="color:white;text-align:center;">JULY 18, 2018</h3>
    <h4 style="color:red;text-align:center;">i wonder what memories people will have of me once i'm gone. i wonder what</br>will come to mind when they think of me; something i said or did</br>one random day, something that completely defines their perception of me.</br>everybody will have something different. not having the ability to control that</br>can be frustrating, but i guess you just have to let things like this be.</h4><br><br><br>
